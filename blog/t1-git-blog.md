Git and GitHub

16th Oct 2014

Since high school, I have been doing my own form of version control for my projects. Starting with a rough draft and having different versions of my power point presentation, something like SciPP_v1 and SciPP_v2. It was not easy to manage and it got even more complicated during my undergraduate work, when I had to do group projects. Trying to keep track of all the work every team member was doing, became a nightmare. 

I wish I had known about version control system then. A software that helps to track changes and keep track of different versions for you. It tracks all the changes you make so that if you need, you can go back to the version of your project that you require. One such system is called Git. In simple terms, it lets you make changes to your document, and when you hit save, it stores that information with date and time stamp as well as your own note that you put in at the time of saving. When you encounter a bug or a problem with your document and you need to go back to the version that was working for you, you can easily do so now. 

Git helps you keep track of projects you are working on your own computer.What is you are working on the project in a team? For that, there is GitHub. With GitHub, your project lives on the Internet. You can have multiple team members working on different parts of the project at the same time and still keep the integrity of the original project. In addition to keeping track of the versions, GitHub will create branches or copies of the project so that multiple people can work on them and the Main project would still remain unchanged. Through GitHub, you can create your own library of projects and share them. 

I have just started using these tools and I will keep track of how it works out.
