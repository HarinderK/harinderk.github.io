	<h3>Object Oriented Programming Concepts:Variable Scope</h3>
	    <p>Variable Scope in Ruby means the accessibility of the variables. You can have five different types of variable scopes:</p>

<p>1.	Global Variable: These are accessible from anywhere in the program. They are prefixed with a dollar sign($). Eg. $global_var = 10. </p>
<p>2.	Class Variable: These are shared amongst all instances of a class. For each class instance they have the same values. Eg. @@class_var = 10. </p>
<p>3.	Instance Variable: These are also shared amongst all instances of a class. But, for each class instance they have different values. Eg. @instance_var = 10. </p>
<p>4.	Local Variable: These are local to the code area in which they are declared. For eg. local_var = 10. </p>
<p>5.	Constant : This is a constant that will never change. In Ruby, you can actually change a constant, but it will give you a warning before doing that. Eg. CONSTANT =10. </p>
