	<h3>Thinking Style</h3>
	    <p>
	    	According to the Gregorc Thinking Style, my thinking style is Abstract Random. This means I thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments. I am not sure I understand this theory completely. But after years of self-introspection, I have found some things about my thinking style.</p>

	    <p> I am a logical thinker. I understand things better when I do them. I also need some guidance on new topics and subjects. The internet is full of so much information, that I get distracted and confused if I try to learn it all by myself. Often this discourages me to learn. But if an expert in that subject can point the best resources to me, it helps me to learn faster and efficiently.</p>

	    <p> I also learned from this week's GPS session, how important it is to have a growth mindset and a learner's attitude. This allowed me to learn more from different perspectives. </p>
