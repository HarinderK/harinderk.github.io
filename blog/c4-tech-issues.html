	<h3>Problems facing the technology world</h3>
	    <p>One of the biggest problems facing the tech world today is that there are not enough women working in technology.  According to National Center for Women and Information Technology, in 2013, only 26% of computing workforce were women.</p>  

		<p>There are many reasons for this imbalance in workforce; one of the major one is that women are not getting into tech related study majors. In 2012, only 18% of the graduates of computer science were women. </p> 

		<p>Some ways that might help solve this problem are:</p> 

		<ul>

		<li>Reaching out to female high school students and informing them about their options, exposing them to all possibilities </li>
		<li>Creating a friendly workplace environment and policies </li>
		<li>Tech programs that encourage female participation </li>

		</ul>
