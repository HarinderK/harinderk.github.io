	<h3>Pairing and Feedback</h3>
	    <p>I have started to appreciate the process of collaborative work and feedback ever since I joined DBC. It is great to share someone elseâ€™s perspective on the same problem. Pairing has helped me to easily find solution at places where I was feeling stuck. </p>

		<p>At first, giving feedback was a little difficult. I was finding it hard to put my thoughts into words while keeping in mind the effort and hard work the other person has put in their work. But it is getting easier every way. I was pleasantly surprised to read my own feedback. Everyone has been kind and considerate. It encourages me and motivates me. </p>
