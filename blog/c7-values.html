	<h3>Values</h3>
	    <p>When I think of the times in my life where I’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind : Creativity, Integrity, Introspection and Ambition. </p>

		<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being highly agree, I try to live up to these values at a scale of 4. </p>

		<p>Introspection, especially self-introspection is very important to me because I feel lost if I don’t give time to this aspect in my life. The last time someone asked my advice was not on self-introspection, but about integrity.</p>

		<p>I believe, the first step to combat any fear is recognizing it. It helps me to verbalize it or write it down so I can come back to it later whenever I need to reflect. </p>
