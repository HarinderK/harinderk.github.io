      <p>1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?
I was working as a Broadcast Engineer in Calgary, Alberta and I initiated a project that would result in upgrade of the software system company wide. I was also in charge of training employees on the new system. Everyday, I found this increasingly difficult because my co workers were not following my directions correctly.They would not read up on materials in would give and as a result would ask to repeat the training session again and again.</p>

<p>2. What was the source of the conflict?
I beleive that for me the source of conflict was that my co-workers were not taking me seriously. I was put in charge of the traning sessions and I held the responsibility to complete it successfully. But I couldn't do it without the help of my co-workers. I didn't feel heard, I felt alone and didn't feel like it was a team effort.</p>

<p>3. What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?
I felt a bit helpless, angry and frustrated. I also felt some anxiety to finish the project.</p>

<p>4. What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?
I decided to talk about my concerns to my co-workers. I told them candidly how I was feeling a lot of pressure to complete the training program on time and how I didn't feel they were helping.</p>

<p>5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
I would begin the session differently. It is true that I was their co-worker, but for the purpose of this project I was in chanrge and driving the project. I would begin by asking for their cooperation and making sure we proceed as a team.</p>

<p>6. What did you learn from this experience?
That it is generally good to try and anticipate any conflicts that might arise when starting a new project. If a conflict does occure, it is important to dissolve it quickly with yourself and then with others.</p>
