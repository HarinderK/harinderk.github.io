<h4>DBC Culture</h4>

<h4>16th Oct. 2014</h4>

DBC experience and impressions: DBC seems like an encouraging environment where I can not only be a receiver (or customer), but also a contributor at my level. It feels like an open culture where I am expected to have concerns and I am able to voice those concerns. It is a place where I can meet people from all walks of life, but with same doubts, objectives and passions as I might have. 

Engaging with DBC culture and expectations: I thrive in collaborative environment, where I can actually work on a skill everyday. I have a learner's attitude and I think DBC provides me with an environment where I am not expected to become an expert on one thing, but rather develop skills to learn for a lifetime. I see myself working on a project from day one and engaging a lot with instructors and fellow students.

I am very excited to be a part of such an environment. I am a little nervous as well, going into a new place, meeting new people. I am concerned about how I would do in the class, and how I would do with other students. But, I keep reminding myself of Shereef's video, not thinking too much about my doubts and coming in with a determined, passionate learner's attitude.
